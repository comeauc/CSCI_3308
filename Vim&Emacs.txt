Editing with Vim and Emacs
by Duanfeng Gao

1. Intro to Vim and Emacs
  
   Vim and Emacs are the most powerful and famous editors.

2. Essentials for Vim 
   
   2.1 Open/Create Files
   
       You can open a file with the command “vim file.name”.
       If the file named "file.name" exists, vim will open the file. 
       If the file named "file.name" does not exist, vim will create a new file named "file.name".
       
       You can also create a file with the command "vim" without a file name. In this case, vim would create a new file with no file name and you need to name the file when you save the file.
